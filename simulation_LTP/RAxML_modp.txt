IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 8 columns that contain only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data.
Normally these columns should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
undetermined columns removed is printed to file realLTP_correct.afa.reduced
